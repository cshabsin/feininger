Clip oil paint filters to shape boundaries

- Added final `feComposite` step with `operator="in"` to all directional stroke filters (`strokeH`, `strokeV`, `strokeRough`).
- This ensures that the generated textures and lighting are strictly masked by the displaced polygon's alpha channel, removing rectangular filter artifacts around figures and other elements.

Gemini commit: the filter over the people should clip at the edge of the figures, rather than being seen as rectangles over the people.
