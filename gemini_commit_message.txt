Initial commit: Feininger Prismatism Generator

- Implemented V1 "Sails" generation with crystalline geometry.
- Implemented V2 "Intentional Figures" with:
  - Ground/Sea/Sky regions with clipped broad partitioning textures.
  - Detailed figures (men in suits, women in dresses) with randomized styles (arms, hats, shawls).
  - Opaque figures with correct blending.
  - "Prismatism" light beams overlay.
- Next.js UI with history navigation and version selector.
- SVG rendering with clip paths and blend modes.

Gemini commit: some men should be in brown suits instead of black suits. and generally fewer figures in these, 1-3? these are looking crowded.
